Problem statement
=================

Users today are all about their photos, they take photos wherever they go but
sometimes the photo is not right. It might just need a spark or a bit of a
touch-up but where can you go to easily provide this? Fotosizer exists, yes, but
the problem is that it is a bit outdated to what users currently are used to.
Users want a user-friendly program adapted to newer features that are used
nowadays. Users today want a program that can easily manipulate many photos
effortlessly without having to waste hours learning a new program such as
fotosizer or even photoshop. Most importantly users will not be spending an
exorbitant amount of money on editing programs so therefore an affordable
solution must be provided.

The users today admit that they do not have much time to learn complex programs,
the user also admits that they would not be willing to spend a lot of money on
editing a simple photo. That is why I propose to create a free and easy
user-friendly photo manipulating program that will be known as Photo Castle 1.0.

Users will be able to edit photos in bulk and create masterpieces with a
user-friendly menu and with no need to become photoshop experts. In only a
matter of seconds, a user can become an expert in Photo Castle without being
limited to any restrictions. The effortless and unlimited photo editing program
is a solution to the many issues faced by the newest and youngest generation
coming forward into the world. This is my purpose in creating Photo Castle 1.0
and the solution to many photo editing blunders that have been bothering our new
generation.

Project Description
-------------------

Summary: Photo Castle 1.0 is going the be the baby born from photoshop and
fotosizer but far better. The program should help users easily and efficiently
edit photos in a matter of seconds. The interface of PC1.0 (Photo Castle 1.0)
will be simple yet limitless as the user needs to be able to learn it and
understand it without having to pull up an entire manual or have to watch a long
YouTube instructional video about it. The user shall receive many preset filters
that they can add to photos so they do not have to start at step \#1 and spend
hours editing photos.

-   Feature \#1: Resizing, Rotating, Optimizing, and Cropping (Easy clickable
    add-ons – Unless they go Pro mode)

-   Feature \#2: A Pro mode that can be enabled in the menu to provide more
    customization for the semiprofessionals coming from photoshop.

-   Feature \#2: Adding border effects, backgrounds, and customizing borders

-   Feature \#3: Preset filters that change the entire photo

-   Feature \#4: Skin smoothing effects/Cosmetic effects

-   Feature \#5: Easy access from the homepage and windows explorer selection
    from menu.

-   Feature \#6: Simple yet neat and innovative design that is not an eye sore
    (Dark mode included)

-   Feature \#7: Extra click to have more options feature, subtle and not
    complex.

Proposed Implementation Language(s)
-----------------------------------

-   Language \#1: Mostly C++

-   Language \#2: Other scripting languages possibly

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation language(s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Library \#1: Qt

-   Library \#2: IDE QT creator

-   Library \#3: Once I do more research on what I plan to implement then I will
    add those libraries.

Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------

-   Qt program for the design interface (https://www.qt.io/)

-   Visual Basic

-   Need \#3: NetBeans

Personal Motivation
-------------------

-   Motivation \#1: Improve my C++ language skills and further my knowledge in
    all the different areas of C++. Out of the languages I have learned, C++ is
    my favorite and I was upset I did not get to code much more in C++. However,
    this project will definitely provide me the experience I so much desired.

-   Motivation \#2: Learn and understand how to use GUI’s and interfaces that
    are a bit more advanced. I loved the idea of using Qt as the design
    interface program for my project simply because it was used to create the
    same interface in my Mercedes-Benz and I think it is one of the best
    interfaces used on a vehicle by far.

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

-   Step \#1: Figure out how the main interface will look, feel, features and
    accessibilities added.

-   Step \#2: Make sure I know the libraries and packages that need to be
    included for my code to work.

-   Step \#3: Begin coding in C++ for the base program and make sure the base
    cases/functions work.

-   Sep \#4: Research and learn how Qt works, watch tutorials, and view example
    programs.

-   Step \#5: Learn QT and Research how to use QT in my own code.

-   Step \#6: IDE Qt creator, figure out and see if using this is better than
    visual basic.

-   Step \#7: Integrate C++ code with Qt to have a nice-looking GUI/interface.

-   Step \#8: Update the interface, clean the code up, and add any more features
    that were not added before

-   Step \#9: Run the program and run test cases to make sure no bugs appear.
